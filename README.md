# NUKE-Finance
An attempt to use ML and RL with my personal NUKE architecture to develop a trading algorithm.
Uses a multi-model approach. With multiple prediction models with multiple horizon making forecasts about stock values
that are then fed into a RL-trained trading algorithm.

Also implements some (hopefully) useful yfinance API scrapping method for pulling entire indices.
